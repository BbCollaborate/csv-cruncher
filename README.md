CSV Cruncher - query and process your CSVs using SQL.
====================================================

A tool which treats CSV files AS SQL tables, and exports CSV files using a SQL `SELECT` statement.

Many tools and systems can export their data to CSV - comma separated values.
Typical work with these data is importing them into some spreadsheet like Excel and process them manually.

With this tool, you can automate this processing by writing SQL queries, which produce another CSV as a result.
The SQL operations can be quite powerful â€“ just consider what everything you have at hand:

 * Simple selects - ordering, filtering, grouping, aggregating, etc.
 * Joins - use multiple CSV files and use their relations
 * Subselects (pre-computing certain data for another select)
 * Self-joins (same input file used multiple times)
 * Recursive queries
 * Triggers
 * User-defined functions (PL/SQL-based and Java-based)
 * XML and JSON processing
 * Time and date functions
 * Statistical agregate functions

...and more.

All this is backed by [HyperSQL database](http://hsqldb.org/).
See it's very rich [SQL syntax and features documentation](http://hsqldb.org/doc/2.0/guide/dataaccess-chapt.html).

Usage
=====

    crunch [-in] <in-CSV>, <in-CSV-2>, ... [-out] <out-CSV> [-sql] "<SQL>"

(The `crunch` script yet to be done. Currently you need to run `java -jar CsvCruncher.jar <args>`.)

Usage example
=============

    crunch myInput.csv output.csv \
        "SELECT AVG(duration) AS durAvg FROM (SELECT * FROM myInput ORDER BY duration LIMIT 2 OFFSET 6)"

Data and usage example
======================

CSV data

    ## jobName, buildNumber, config, ar, arFile, deployDur, warmupDur, scale
    'eap-5.1.0-perf-deployers', 355,'production','testdata/war/hellothere.war','hellothere.war',10282,14804,1000
    'eap-5.1.0-perf-deployers', 355,'production','testdata/ear/EarWithWar-Counter.ear','EarWithWar-Counter.ear',11005,18904,1000
    'eap-5.1.0-perf-deployers', 355,'production','testdata-own/war/war-big-1.0.war','war-big-1.0.war',1966,14800,100
    ...

SQL query:

    SELECT jobName, buildNumber, config, ar, arFile, deployDur, warmupDur, scale,
            CAST(warmupDur AS DOUBLE) / CAST(deployDur AS DOUBLE) AS warmupSlower
        FROM indata ORDER BY deployDur

----------------------------------------------
This was migrated from Google Code.
The code here is decompiled and reverse-engineered from a  .jar I found on my web.
It seems to work, but testing, feedback, and pull requests welcome.
If it was useful to you, star this github repo :)

Easter Egg: The original text I sent to JBoss mailing list when introducing the tool :)

> Many tools spit out CSV, or are able to as one of output options. Also, in hudson, you can very simply log any values you get into bash like echo " $val2, $val2" >> data.csv, for each build or part of a build. So it can be kind of integration tool.

> Then you can do quite complex queries - from a flat table, you can actually do subselects and then left joins, which gives you very powerful tool to process the data into something what is ready for plotting as-is - that means, data filtered, cleaned, aggregated, converted, aligned, sorted, etc.
>
> That might be my POV, since I like SQL and it's my favorite language not only for querying but also data-oriented procedural programming. But nonetheless, I already shortened my perf test task by ~ 40 minutes of my work for each release. Instead of manual shannanigans in OpenOffice, I run a single command, and voila ;-)
